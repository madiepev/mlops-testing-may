# Work with linting and unit testing

Code quality can be assessed in two ways: linting and unit testing. Use linting to check for any stylistic errors and unit testing to verify your functions.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't, complete the [set-up](00-set-up.md) before you continue.

You'll also need the GitHub Action that triggers the Azure Machine Learning pipeline created in Challenge 3. 

## Learning objectives

By completing this challenge, you'll learn how to:

- Run linters and unit tests with GitHub Actions.
- Troubleshoot errors to improve your code.

## Tasks

In the **tests** folder, you'll find files that will perform linting and unit testing on your code. 

Add the following steps to the GitHub Action to run the linter and unit tests:

```yml
```

After running a workflow with the linter and unit tests for the first time, you're likely to get errors.

- Fix your code according to the linter rules.
- Troubleshoot any errors to ensure the unit tests run successfully.

## Success criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to show:

- A successfully completed Action in your GitHub repo that includes linting and unit testing.
